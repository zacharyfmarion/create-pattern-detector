# Agent Notes

## Shared Scraped Dataset

Do not copy the scraped real-world crease pattern dataset into each git worktree.

The shared dataset lives outside the repo at:

```text
/Users/zacharymarion/Documents/datasets/create-pattern-detector/scraped
```

Each worktree should access it through this ignored symlink:

```text
data/output/scraped -> /Users/zacharymarion/Documents/datasets/create-pattern-detector/scraped
```

For a new worktree, run:

```bash
scripts/data/link_shared_scraped_data.sh
```

If the dataset lives somewhere else on a machine, set one of:

```bash
export CP_SHARED_DATA_ROOT=/path/to/create-pattern-detector-datasets
export CP_SCRAPED_DATASET=/path/to/create-pattern-detector-datasets/scraped
```

Then rerun:

```bash
scripts/data/link_shared_scraped_data.sh
```

The script refuses to replace a non-empty `data/output/scraped` directory unless it only contains metadata such as `.DS_Store`.

Keep raw dataset files, crops, manifests, and generated reports out of git. Commit small code, docs, config examples, tests, and deterministic fixture manifests instead.
